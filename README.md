If you're here because you want to look at the awful mess that is this mod, feel free. It's an awful mess. I got lazier with it as time went on. Can you believe I actually wanted to transpile everything? Maybe if I didn't want to get this out by April Fool's day.

If you're here because for some reason you want to contribute, then feel free to submit a PR to mirror something that's hardcoded that you found. There's a lot of it still in the game. But despite what I just said above this, if you do, I would really like you to do your best to make it compatible with things. Some of these hardcoded things are in very large functions or very important ones, and I will _not_ accept skipping prefixes willy nilly. Also please follow the """style""" of how I laid out the code in this mod. Separate patch classes, named after what they're patching (mostly), etc. Thanks.
